# Scrimba Full-Stack Developer Path Projects

## Overview

This repository contains my projects from the Scrimba Full-Stack Developer Path. I'm uploading these projects to GitHub as a way to:

1. Practice Git workflows and commands regularly
2. Maintain an active GitHub profile
3. Document my learning journey
4. Keep a record of smaller projects while taking a break from larger ones

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of exercises and projects I complete while following the Scrimba curriculum. While these may be smaller in scope compared to my other repositories, they demonstrate consistent coding practice and skills development.

## My Learning Goals

- Master modern web development fundamentals
- Build a solid foundation in full-stack development
- Create responsive, interactive web applications
- Document my progress through regular commits
- Apply best practices in code organization and documentation

## Structure

The repository is organized by modules/sections from the Scrimba Full-Stack Developer Path, with each project in its own directory.

## Technologies

Technologies covered in this learning path include:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Databases
- And more as I progress through the curriculum

## Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository regularly as I complete new modules. Feel free to watch my progress and provide feedback!

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my learning journey!
